### Early Mental Health Risk Detection for Students  

SentinelMind is a privacy-first, AI-powered early warning system designed to identify early signs of emotional distress in students and enable timely, human-centered intervention. The platform focuses on prevention, support, and responsible AI use in mental healthcare.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Mental health crises among students are rarely sudden events.  
They are often the result of prolonged, unaddressed emotional distress.

In educational institutions:
- Students hesitate to seek help due to stigma and fear of judgment
- Warning signs such as withdrawal, mood changes, and emotional exhaustion go unnoticed
- Existing systems are reactive rather than preventive

There is a lack of scalable, ethical, and continuous early-detection systems that support students before a crisis occurs.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

SentinelMind provides:
- Low-effort daily emotional check-ins
- AI-driven analysis of emotional tone and sentiment
- Early risk detection without diagnosis
- Human-in-the-loop escalation for timely support

The system is designed to **assist caregivers and institutions**, not replace human care.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Students submit optional daily check-ins (text or mood-based)
2. Azure OpenAI analyzes contextual emotional patterns
3. Azure AI Language performs sentiment and emotion classification
4. A risk score is generated (Low / Medium / High)
5. Based on risk level:
   - Self-care resources are suggested
   - Counselors are notified when necessary
   - Emergency escalation is enabled only when required
